# CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript Final Project

Hello, my name is Santiago Nessy.

Before talking about the project I want to give you a bit of context. I played Professional Baseball for 12 years and in 2018 I became a Coach at [IMG Academy](https://www.imgacademy.com). Here at IMG we have a very high flow of athletes that come and go throughout the year and we always have to give them a report on how their performance was during their stay at IMG, this is usually done by sending an email to the parents and That's all problem solved but as a former Player I ask you how many times do we not understand or simply forget what our Coach tells us or explains? How many days go by without having a clear vision of how or when to make an adjustment that will help us improve? So as a Coach I asked myself how we can improve communication between students/athletes and Coaches and make our work as coaches a little easier? And as a player, how can I easily understand what my Coach wants to tell me or how do I remember everything that my Coach wants me to remember? and it was there when it occurred to me to make a web application called IMGReportApp where at the end of the day I can enter and write a brief report about my athletes where I can let them know how they did it or what are the things that they need to improve among many other things .

With this product it becomes easier for us coaches to maintain constant communication with the athletes and we can easily keep a record of the athletes' development and the athletes will find it easier to understand and put into practice all those things that we simply sometimes forget and undermines the development of athletes.



## IMGReportApp 

IMGReportApp is split into 2 main paths "/coach" and "/student".

***"/coach"***  is the route that serves coaches and will allow them to use the functions of creating teams, players and sending daily reports to athletes. Coaches can register and login and start writing reports to players.

***"/students"*** is the path that serves students/athletes. This route is simple since the students will only be able to read the report written by the coaches. In the future I would like the athletes to be able to evaluate the reports and ask for clarification if they do not understand 100% what the coach wrote.



# Understanding The Files

## FinalProject
This is the main Django Project where two applications are generated, the first called MyReport and the second Student

### MyReport:
#### views.py:
##### index:


### ***cerebro.dart*** 
Is a file that contains the main function that is CalculatorBrain, inside there are several functions where the body mass index is calculated and depending on the result, the following functions are accessed that result in a possible status according to the user's weight and a little advice according to the weight of the user.


### ***Constantes.dart***  
This is where the various styles are that were used and will be reused throughout the entire app.
